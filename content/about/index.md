Hello! My name is Angel Vyas, and I am currently pursuing a B.Tech degree with a focus on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. I have a passion for programming, especially in Python, which I thoroughly enjoy exploring. Whenever I have free time, I love trekking in the mountains, which brings me closer to nature and provides a sense of adventure. Additionally, I enjoy playing the guitar and flute, which are great outlets for my creativity and relaxation.
