Hi, I'm Angel Vyas, currently pursuing a B.Tech degree in Data Science. I have a passion for programming, which I thoroughly enjoy exploring. I enjoy traveling and making new friends. I also have a strong interest in music, and I like to play the flute and guitar, which are excellent ways for me to unwind and express my creativity.djhfd fdjfh
