When we set our new system, while setting up an operating system on our system, we got an option to select the hard disk, do I want to divide my memory in certain section, you can divide the memory in n number of section but for my case I have divided it into  two parts which is C: drive (which is the local drive) and the D: drive. 

After going in my local drive we have the system files which contains the code of the operating system, and many other files also exist, one of the file among those is users, we can have many users for one system, in my case inside user folder I have two files, one is my default user, another file is public, which is can be used when I want to add  a guest user. 

In user file, I have my all applications and the stuff that I save as an user on my device.
