Hi Everyone !!! 

This time, I want to introduce myself as **WHO AM I**. I should have done this earlier, but since it's never too late, here is a little introduction of **WHO I AM**.  

My name is **Angel Vyas**, sounds like Christian right?? But no, I'm a Hindu (Vyas). I was born and brought up in Jaipur, Rajasthan and my schooling was done there itself (MGPS), currently I'm in the second year of my college pursuing B tech in Data Science at MGIT, Hyderabad.  


#### Wait but why MGIT all the way from Jaipur?

The answer for this is that I'm a JEE dropper, I took a drop after 12th but unfortunately the drop was not successful, I failed my drop year, ended up with 94 percentile in my JEE Mains, with which I was not getting Computer Science in NITs (General category ðŸ˜”), and other branches like chemical and mechanical I was not interested, So I started looking for other colleges when my father asked  if I want to start college in Hyderabad (as his job was there itself.) After giving it some thought, I decided to shift to Hyderabad for my college to get started and got admitted to MGIT, Hyd.  

For my whole life I believed that I'm an Introvert but after coming to college there was a hard realization  that I'm an ambivert I love talking to people, making new friends, taking part in different activities, going on trips, and much more things that I'm not getting into my head right now. 

About my **hobbies**, I love music, I love playing my guitar and my flute and want to learn other instruments as well in future, other than music my hobbies includes swimming, writing, going on impromptu drives every Friday. 
Other than these I'm an **A - Certificate NCC Cadet**. (Just want to tell you guys ðŸ˜…). 

And that's all I'm getting into my head about myself, so for now I'm going to stop this here. 

Thank you so much for patiently reading till here. 

Meet you guys in my next blog. 

Till then BYE, take care...
