### Some sample code 

## Images

### Local image, alt text as caption

The following image is located within the Hugo site. Because it has alt text but no title text, the caption is generated by the alt text.

![Jane Doe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity/master/exampleSite/static/images/jane-doe.png)

### Remote image, specified caption

The following image is loaded from a remote URL. The alt text is the same (for screen readers and in cases when the image doesn't load) but because a separate title is provided, the title is used for the caption:

![Jane Doe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity/master/exampleSite/static/images/jane-doe.png "This is Jane Doe")

### Image with alt text and no caption

Alt text is always recommended for SEO, accessibility and in cases when images don't load. However, you don't necessarily always want an image to have a caption. In that case, use a title with one space:

![A building](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity/master/exampleSite/static/images/jane-doe.png " ")

## Blockquotes

The blockquote element represents content that is quoted from another source, optionally with a citation which must be within a `footer` or `cite` element, and optionally with in-line changes such as annotations and abbreviations.

#### Blockquote without attribution

> Tiam, ad mint andaepu dandae nostion secatur sequo quae.
> **Note** that you can use *Markdown syntax* within a blockquote.

#### Blockquote with attribution

> Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.<br>
> — <cite>Rob Pike[^1]</cite>

[^1]: The above quote is excerpted from Rob Pike's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAAkCSZUG1c) during Gopherfest, November 18, 2015.
